# Lemon
Currently it is basically a OpenGL Framework for me to mess around with.
My plan is to have a basis to implement some cool scenes and practice common techniques such as shadow maps, deferred rendering, etc.

## Why lemon ?
I started graphics programming because I watched a documentary about Lemon sharks and I wanted to simmulate the enviornment in a computer.
